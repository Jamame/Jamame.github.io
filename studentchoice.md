## Introduction

Pavlov (also known as Pavlov VR), is a multiplayer VR first person shooter first released in 2017. Players will fight in fast-paced small maps with similar gameplay mechanics to Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Players will use an arsenal of weapons to eliminate each other in PvP modes, or fight AI Zombies in the PvE zombies mode. The game has a heavy focus on the community, and features reloading physics and features with both modern and WWII guns. Despite being an old game, it is considered by most one of the must buys when it comes to VR games. It is currently available on Steam for $25 using this [Link.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555160/Pavlov_VR/)

## Why is it a good use of VR or AR?

Pavlov is a good use of VR, as it gives a more immersive experience than its competitor, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and adds to it. Instead of pressing a button to reload, the game forces the user to manually replicate a reload, by taking a magazine from the user’s waist, ejecting the current weapon’s cartridge, and entering the new magazine into a weapon. Some weapons also force the user to cock their gun, and have realistic recoil, further adding to the authenticity and realism of the game. Aiming also requires the user to physically move their whole body around, rather than simulating actions through a keyboard and mouse. The user's hands and own body are displayed in game, tracking them in real time, making the user feel as if they were actually in the game. The game also allows users to interact with other users, like tossing guns or ammo to each other, and being able to use them. All of these features help the game also feel more social and interactable, rather than the user being in their own world.

## Who are its intended users?

This game is intended for people who want to play something like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, or a military simulator in a more immersive experience. Despite this, this game is also popular among more casual gamers, as the controls are intuitive and simple. Due to the gore and violence, the age target is gamers ranging from 18-30. The game also requires a lot of physical activity, so it is also intended for people that want to use their full body and range of motion, rather than sitting down to play a video game. This game focuses heavily on the fact that is a team based game. Pavlov also has a social aspect to it, as the team that is more effectively able to communicate and work together usually ends up winning.
